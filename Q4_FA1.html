            <p>Do you want to help people or make a difference? Do you want to make a positive change in someone’s life? Do you like getting your hands dirty? Then, you should join Bhay Tuluyan! Bahay Tuluyan is an organization dedicated to promoting the dignity of all children and preventing abuse and violence against them. In order to give young people a comprehensive, rights-based, and empowering approach to development, they operate ten programs with an emphasis on Resilient Children, Empowered Youth, Safe Families, and Child Friendly Communities. The group strives for a society in which each child's rights are upheld, safeguarded, and realized. More volunteers are being sought by Bahay Tuluyan to assist with expenses and take part in other facets of their work, including training module development, business plan drafting, and rice planting. They want for volunteers who are willing to try new things and who can match their skills and time to the needs of the organization. With this in mind, take this as your sign! Join our cause and make a change in someone’s life.</p>
